  "aboutProjectText": "GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. GraphQL Playground ships with basic features such as syntax highlighting, intelligent type ahead of fields, real-time error highlighting and reporting for queries and variables, documentation explorer, search, markdown support, and so much more.",
